# [A DRAFT DOCUMENT] Resource-Wise IoT Crystals Science Network

A repository for the public website for `rws` project

 * Get an additional monetary income stream from your unused Android devices resources! Install the 100% Free iotcrystals app and get paid in Ethereum ETH20 tokens RWS!
 * Public website: https://iotcrystals.now.sh/
 * Vercel dev dashboard: https://vercel.com/linear-et-nonlinear-chaos-order-etc-etal/iotcrystals-now-sh-svelte-whale-k5t9
 * Project codename: `rws`
 * Project status: Inception
 * Token Tickers: $RWS $RWSCI
 * Initial planned blockchain network for a token: ERC20 RWS token at https://ethereum.org/
 * Initial planned ERC20 RWS token emission: 10B
 * Initial planned ERC20 RWS token decimal places after comma: 18
 * Initial Ethereum networks for emission: Testnet, then Mainnet
 * Investments to extend R&D and software developers team are welcome!
 * Competing & integrated & collaborating projects: https://golem.network/ & https://iex.ec/ ; maybe others, too, as research progresses.
 * Initial planned IoT platform: Android
 * Initial planned way to implement user devices platform for executing semi-arbitrary code: a fast optimized custom low-level VM to interact with low-level Android OS internals to make the user experience seamless and friction-free
 * Head cloud interacts with IoT devices VMs
 * 5% of IoT devices VMs tokens income would go to the project RWS DAO stakeholders
 * 75% of project RWS DAO $RWSSTAKE tokens would be pre-minted and pre-allocated to the the core RWS founders team `rwsfounderscollective` members as stakeholders
 * The rest 25% of project RWS DAO $RWSSTAKE ETH tokens would be 100% allocated to the pool of $RWSOBLIGATIONS ETH tokens holders. $RWSOBLIGATIONS ETH tokens are to be sometimes sold via ETH, USD, etc., and can also be burned if an $RWSOBLIGATIONS token holder chooses to do so. $RWSOBLIGATIONS would add RWS project's revenues as $RWS tokens to the addresses of $RWSOBLIGATIONS holders proportionally to the amount of their $RWSOBLIGATIONS holdings.
 * The `RWSDAO` ways & habits would be borrowed & inherited from the `bisq` blockchain DeFi project. The RWSDAO is planned for the future.
 * RWS DAO ETH token: RWSSTAKE $RWSSTAKE
 * The current free & libre opensource GPLv3-licensed source code is at https://github.com/nonlin-lin-chaos-order-etc-etal/iotcrystals-now-sh-svelte-whale

## SvelteKit

Example project using SvelteKit with the [SpaceX GraphQL API](https://api.spacex.land/graphql/), deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

### Deploy Your Own

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fvercel%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fexamples%2Fsveltekit&project-name=sveltekit-vercel&repository-name=sveltekit-vercel&demo-title=SvelteKit%20%2B%20Vercel&demo-description=SvelteKit%20app%20fetching%20data%20from%20the%20SpaceX%20GraphQL%20API.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fsveltekit.examples.vercel.com%2F&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fsveltekit.examples.vercel.com%2Ftwitter.png)

_Live Example: https://sveltekit.examples.vercel.com_

### Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Building

This uses the [Vercel Adapter](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/adapter-vercel) for SvelteKit.

```bash
npm run build
```
